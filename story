Once upon a time there lives a rabbit who said that he can beat any animal in a race.
He asked for challengers, but all the animals denied , finally a tortoise came farword
and accepted his challenge.

They started with the race on the very next day. The rabbit had a very big lead
and because he was confident about his winning so he stopped to take a nap under a tree.

The tortoise kept on going with the race as the rabbit slept. Eventually the tortoise 
kept going and won the race.
